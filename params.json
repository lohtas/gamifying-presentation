{"name":"Gamifying Information Presentation","tagline":"Lorena Saria-Huertas","body":"#Information Visualization Skills Training Game\r\nI propose that any Information Organization - such as public, school, academic, or special libraries - can adopt my game. The learning outcomes of my game are teaching design principles that would enhance the effectiveness of creating data visualization, namely charts and graphs. Depending on the job description, learning effective visualization skills would be beneficial for staff, teachers, librarian assistants, and librarians in conveying complex information to a diverse community of patrons and students with varying language and learning levels. Visualizations can sometimes transcend language barriers and often times are used as a type of universal language (although it would still be limited to cultural norms.) Administrators, directors, managers, and supervisors would therefore need to encourage staff to learn these new skills.\r\n\r\n## Goals of Institution + Goals of Game play\r\nIn general, a library’s mission is to connect the community they serve to free and open resources in its widest sense. My game falls in line with most libraries’ goals in that it teaches staff to enhance their information conveyance skills. Playing this game would allow staff to serve a diverse community in more effective ways.\r\n\r\n## Game Promoters\r\nAdministration, Directors, Managers, Supervisors\r\n## Game Players \r\nStaff, Teachers, Librarian Assistants, Librarians\r\n\r\n## Strategy to attract players\r\nStarting with administration or a branch manager (the promoter), a player can share the link to the game with a co-worker as a challenge or friendly invitation to play. I would try to add a gallery feature to the game that will enable players to save their favorite visualizations for other players to view and compare. Since most of the solutions to the puzzle are actually flexible and open-ended, this would allow for comparison between players to show off their creativity and inspire others.\r\n\r\n## Annotated Bibliography of Information Visualization Game\r\n###Boyd, J. P. (2000 - to be published). The Gospel According to Tufte. In  Engineering 503: Scientific visualization and information architecture course notes (chapter 2). http://www-personal.umich.edu/~jpboyd/eng403_chap2_tuftegospel.pdf\r\nThis chapter is actually taken from Boyd’s course notes for the Engineering course he teaches at UMich: ENG 503: Scientific Visualization and Information Architecture. This chapter is devoted to explaining Tufte’s design principles for stripping down data visualizations to the most basic elements in order to showcase the data in its simplest form. These design principles go beyond Few’s in that it is not limited to graphs focused on the needs of business. Teaching these principles might be beyond the scope of my game, but I am considering including summarized versions of these principles as either tips or notes in the answers I provide as a way to justify the decisions that went into creating the solutions.\r\n\r\n###Few, S. (2005). Effectively communicating numbers: Selecting the best means and manner of display (White paper). Boise, ID: ProClarity Corporation. http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/Whitepapers/Communicating_Numbers.pdf\r\nThis white paper is essentially the basis for the graph puzzles embedded in the game. I’m not sure to what extent I will repeat what Few has explained in my game, but his process and guidelines are pretty much the learning outcome I want players to come away with. Even if players don’t rely on Few’s guidelines and just want to put the graph puzzles together, my solutions will be based on Few’s suggestions.\r\n\r\n###Few, S. (2009). Now you see it: Simple visualization techniques for quantitative analysis. San Francisco, CA: Analytics Press.\r\nI plan to use Few’s textbook as a resource for defining key terms. His textbook goes deeper into concepts, theories, and guidelines than the aforementioned white paper. This will be a good resource to refer to when writing up feedback or even for further reading on key concepts and terms that I bring up.\r\n\r\n###Rice, J. W. (2007).

I wanted to read the full assessment and and rationale for his rubric components myself and found them to be incredibly helpful when thinking of ways to implement practical features in my game. I don’t plan to use every element his lists, but will refer to this article as a guideline for designing storylines, player roles, difficulty levels, and meaningful interaction in the form of feedback to player.\r\n\r\n###Segel, E. and Heer, J. (2010). Narrative visualization: Telling stories with data. Visualization and Computer Graphics, IEEE Transactions on, 16(6), 1139-1148. 10.1109/TVCG.2010.179\r\nNow that I’m going over this article again, I’m getting ideas on further puzzles to create. In this article, Segel and Heer explain balancing author-driven and reader driven stories within narrative visualization. The comparison basically describes seven genres of narrative visualization each containing a specific layout that would allow either authors to direct readers what flow to follow when viewing their content or giving readers control over when to move on to the next segment or in which direction they can move in. If I were to translate these into puzzles for my game, I would convert Few’s seven relationships in quantitative business data to level one (and therefore, adjusting the difficulty level to easy or intermediate.) I would then make the next level devoted to recreating the seven genres of narrative visualization. This sounds incredibly ambitious especially for the scope of my game and this class, but maybe if I set out to achieve this initially, I will eventually scale back and only briefly introduce these concepts somehow.\r\n\r\n###Tufte, E. (1990). Envisioning information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press.\r\nEdward Tufte is hailed as a pioneer and expert in the field of data visualizations. And so this text, as well as the next two, are at the core of information visualization fundamentals. This text in particular is filled with colorful examples that I plan to use as inspiration as well as to relay some of the design principles in my game.\r\n\r\n###Tufte, E. (2001). The visual display of quantitative information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press LLC.\r\nThis book contains the design principles discussed by Boyd and Few plus much more. I hope to further my understanding of techniques used to wrangle the more complex data sets and apply them to my game.\r\n\r\n# Polished Badges Game (as Path Game) \r\n[Information Visualization Skills Path Game](http://lohtas.github.io/pathgame/)\r\n\r\n## Polished Assessment Tool\r\n[Polished Assessment Tool](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-9cbZpWtCMqcEtCN09JdmNBQlk/view?usp=sharing)\r\n\r\n## Annotated Bibliography of Assessment tool\r\n\r\n###Ak, O.

Procedia. 46:2477-2481. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042812016357\r\nI found Ak’s game scale to be especially helpful in eliciting great questions to ask when evaluating a game. His research pulls together many other researchers’ results of their own studies to synthesize an evaluation tool of his own. The criteria seem universal and general enough to apply to almost any education game. \r\n\r\n###Kapp, K. M. (2012) Turning novices into experts.

These criteria are important to educational games whose goal is to enlighten the player with new knowledge that will “stick” with the player. \r\n\r\n###Kapp, K.M. (2012).

Most made sense for the type of games he provided as an example, but when it came time to using my assessment tool that used criteria from this chapter, I discovered the flaws in some of his “best practices”. It still provided useful design principles for creating a game, however, which I was able to adjust according to my own needs.\r\n\r\n###McGonigal, J. (2011). Reality is broken: Why games make us better and how they can change the world. NY: Penguin Press.\r\nI found McGonigal’s research helpful in posing questions on the type of hard work involved in game. My original assessment seemed to be lacking in the motivation element and I knew this was a key element in holding a player’s interest in the game, especially in a path game where they follow a linear path.\r\n\r\n###Rice, J.

The criteria he supports allow for elements important and purposeful for education games. \r\n\r\n# Previous Games\r\n### Scavenger Hunt - September 23, 2014\r\n[Summer Vacation Library Scavenger Hunt Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-9cbZpWtCMqSDVSeUJxNTFFT00/view?usp=sharing)\r\n![Summer Vacation Library Scavenger Hunt game screen grab](http://lohtas.github.io/gamifying-presentation/images/scavhunt_.png)\r\n\r\n### Badge Game - October 14, 2014\r\n[Original Information Visualization Badges Game](http://lohtas.github.io/)\r\n![All Badges Layered](http://lohtas.github.io/gamifying-presentation/images/layered_badges.jpg)\r\n\r\n### Social Game - November 4, 2014\r\n[Purple Monkey Dishwasher Game](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-9cbZpWtCMqNW9zWWEzUnBBM1U/view?usp=sharing)\r\n![Purple Monkey Dishwasher social game](http://lohtas.github.io/gamifying-presentation/images/pmd_.jpg)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
